**Requirements for using the ForestPlots.net Report template** 

(This section can be deleted once you're ready to publish your report)

This template is an R Markdown document that uses data from ForestPlots.net to create a user-friendly report about the latest results from your plots.

It produces an html document that reports above-ground biomass (AGB) and stem density for your selected plots. It will also map their location and visualise the rates of biomass change. The template can easily be modified to report and map the quantities that interest you.

**Software requirements**

You will need to install R (version 3.1.2 or later) and RStudio <http://www.rstudio.com/> in your computer to modify and run the template.

In addition to a suite of packages that you will be asked to install when you first run an R Markdown file, you will also need to download the BiomasaFP package for estimating biomass and other forest parameters from data downloaded from ForestPlots.net. This can be obtained from <http://www.ForestPlots.net>.

**Data requirements**

To use this template, you need to download three data files from ForestPlots.net that use your plot data:  
a) The Individuals csv file from the Advanced Search  
b) The Wood density file from the query library  
c) The Plot View metadata file from the query library  

The three files should correspond to the same Plot Views and should be saved in the same working directory, together with the BiomasaFP package and this R Markdown document.

**Instructions**

Once you have installed the programmes and downloaded your data, this template should be ready to run. Open the template in R Studio and set the working directory to the source file location. Clicking the **Knit HTML** button will generate the document; after the document has been produced, you click on 'Open in Browser' to see the final report with tables and maps.

The text in blue below and in italics in the final document can be updated according to the dataset you're using. Indeed, if you are familiar with R, you can customize any aspect of the template to suit the output that you would like to obtain. 

For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

**Introduction**

This document summarises forest inventory data collected by the *RAINFOR network (www.rainfor.org)*.  The plots in this report conform to the following criteria: *multiple census plots*, *minimum diameter of 100mm*, *plot area greater than 0.2 ha*.

The data was downloaded from ForestPlots.net (Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2011; Lopez-Gonzalez et al., 2009) on *date*. The plots included in this report can be found in the table below. 

Note: click on a column header to sort the rows.

**Table 1.** Plot details

```{r dataretrieving, cache=TRUE, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
#reading amd merging datasets
library (BiomasaFP)

# edits final table to make it user-friendly

mergedCensus <- mergefp('IndvData.csv','Metadata.csv','IndvWD.csv' )
Table1 <- SummaryPlotviews(mergedCensus)
Table1friendly <- Table1[-grep('PlotViewID',colnames(Table1))]
  
colnames(Table1friendly )<-c("Country","Plot","Latitude","Longitude","First census","Last census","Number of censuses")

```{r setOptions, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis))

op <- options(gvis.plot.tag='chart')
```{r ,results='asis', echo=FALSE}
Tbl1 <- gvisTable (Table1friendly, formats= list ('Latitude'='#.###', 'Longitude'= '#.###', 'First census' ='#.##', 'Last census' ='#.##'))
plot(Tbl1, options= list (page='enable',height='automatic', width='automatic'))

```

<br>The plot location is shown in Figure 1.</br>

**Figure 1.** Map of plot locations

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
Table1$LatLong<-  paste(Table1$LatitudeDecimal,Table1$LongitudeDecimal, sep=":")
M <- gvisMap(Table1, locationvar = 'LatLong',  options= list (enableScrollWheel=TRUE, useMapTypeControl=TRUE, width =600, height=400, dataMode="markers"))
plot(M)

```
<br></br>

Table 2 shows estimates of aboveground biomass for each plot estimated using the Chave et al. (2005) moist forest equation with height and wood density as parameters. Height was estimated for each tree from its diameter using a Weibull model of the height/diameter relationship with parameters that according to the region where the plot is located (Feldpaush et al. 2011). 

**Table 2** Aboveground biomass (Mg/ha) and stem number for each plot, by census. Plot area (ha) also shown.
```{r, fig.height=4, results='asis',echo=FALSE}
library(BiomasaFP)
Table2 <- SummaryAGB(mergedCensus, AGBChv05MH)

Table2friendly <- Table2[-grep('PlotViewID',colnames(Table1))]
  
colnames(Table2friendly )<-c("Census number", "CountryName","Plot","Plot area", "Latitude","Longitude","Census date","AGB","Stem number")

Tbl2 <- gvisTable (Table2friendly,formats= list ('Latitude'='#.###', 'Longitude'= '#.###', 'Census date' ='#.##','AGB' = '#.##'), options= list (page='enable',height='automatic', width='automatic'))
plot(Tbl2)
```

<br>Aboveground biomass change was estimated as the difference in AGB between the first and last census, divided by the time elapsed (Figure 3). In Figure 3 the rate of biomass change over time is indicated by colour, and the size of the marker represents the AGB in the last census.</br>

**Figure 3.** Map of the rate of change of aboveground biomass (Mg/ha per year)

Note: This type of map includes an option for displaying the specific region or country of interest, by using the appropriate code in the 'region' option of the gvisGeoChart command. In the configuration options you can find the region codes: https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/geomap

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(BiomasaFP)
Table3 <- AGBch(mergedCensus,AGBChv05MH)
Table3$AGBChangeyr <- Table3$AGBChange
Table4 <- LastAGB(mergedCensus,AGBChv05MH)
Table4a <- Table4[, c('PlotViewID', 'AGB')]
Table5 <- merge (Table3, Table4a, by = "PlotViewID")


suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(googleVis))
op <- options(gvis.plot.tag='chart')

Table5$LatLong<-  paste(Table5$LatitudeDecimal,Table5$LongitudeDecimal, sep=":")
M <- gvisGeoChart(Table5, locationvar = 'LatLong', sizevar='AGB', colorvar='AGBChangeyr' ,  options= list (enableScrollWheel=TRUE, useMapTypeControl=TRUE, width =600, height=400, region="005", dataMode="markers"))
plot(M)
```
